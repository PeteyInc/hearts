# Hearts

My name is Jared. I am a student @DevMtn in Provo, Utah.
This is my first stand-alone one-man Angular.js app.

### Objective

1. Create a SPA that will act as a scorecard for the card game *Hearts*
2. Track the performance of players over time.
3. Report and analyze player data via dashboards.
